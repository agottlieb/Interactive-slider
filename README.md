New things I learned/looked up:

first slider- template from w3 schools
cursor: grabbing
CSS/filter brightness to make an existing color darker on an event (filter:)
JS- needed to make linear gradient, use simple math but had to assign a value within a different function in order to multiply like items 

Challenges: 

Known bugs: 
2. box-shadow stay lighter color on grip, picture disappears on hover, and stays on grab
4. check marks further away from the list items 
5. picture change when hover and when grabbing
6. on-start issues shows entire toggle
7. get mini-slider to toggle back
8. convert to desktop
9. on-color when hovering on mini-slider
10. cursors??

# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component

![Design preview for the Interactive pricing component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)

### Page view and pricing totals

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.
