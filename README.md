A Javascript Challenge from Frontend Mentor

The main parts of this challenge were to design two sliders: the first one adjusted price based on pageviews, and the second toggled a 25% discount. I set up a mobile-first design and grabbed slider templates from W3 schools.

For the Javascript portion I assigned values to the slider which adjusted its size according to a linear gradient. I then set up those values to correlate to innerHTML values. Next I created a function for the discount toggle to rewrite the value according to .75 of its original worth, and then to toggle back to the original. I made use of Chrome DevTools to troubleshoot Javascript issues. 

New things I learned doing this project:

1. First slider- template from W3 schools
2. The cursor: grabbing CSS property
3. Using filter: brightness to make an existing color darker on an event
